Docker 
	Docker is one of the tools that used the idea of the isolated resources to 
	create a container that allows applications to be packaged with all the 
	dependencies installed and ran wherever we wanted.
	
	Docker can only run on Linux machines this means I cant install Dokcer directly on Windows or any other OS.
	If I want install Docker on windows then I need to run a Linux VM in windows on top that I need to run Docker.

Virtualization (VM)
	- VM is way of running virtual OS on top a host OS using a special software called Hyperviser.
	- VM directly shares the harware of the host OS. 

					VM 					vs 			Containerisation 
	1. Virtualization at hardware level  		1. Virtualization at OS level 
	2. Heavyweight - consume more host 			2. Lightweight
	   resources 	
	3. VM useses hypervisor 					3. containerisation tool is used 
	4. limited performace - Boot up time        4. Native performace - usualy boot 
		is more which is in minutes 			   fast in seconds.
	5. Cosumes more storage 					5. Shres OS storage means only uses 
												   required storage.
	6. Supports all OS 							6. Supports on Linux

host machine 
	This is the machine in which docker is running 

Docker installation

1. Update ubuntu 
	sudo apt update 

2. Install support packages for Docker
	sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lab-release

3. Need add key to download Docker 
	sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
	
	curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg	

4. Add docker packages to apt repository 
	echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

5. Install Docker 
	sudo apt-get update
 	sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin


Assignment: 1. Create docker hub account 

Login to your hub account 
	docker login 

Just try 
	STEP 1: create directory in /home/ubuntu/jenkins_home 

	Try to run Jenkins 

	docker run -it -d -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 --name jeknis_master -v /home/ubuntu/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:lts

	docker logs -f jeknis_master

Docker images 
	1. To list images in the host machine 
		docker images
	
	2. To download image to host / local machine from docker hub
		docker pull <image_name>:<tag>
	
		docker pull ubuntu:18.04
	   If we won't provide/use any tag then docker will use the default tag "latest"	

	3. To delete docker image
		docker rmi <image_name>:<tag>
			 (OR)
		docker rmi <image_id>
		
	4. Delete multiple images 
		docker rmi <image_id1> <image_id2> ...

	5. Delete images forcefully even if there is a container related to it.
		docker rmi -f <image_id>
	
	6. To list only ids of images 
		docker images -q 
	
	7. To delete all local images 
		docker rmi $(docker images -q)
	

	To push a images to our own repository

		1. Create a tag which matches our repository name 
			image_name
				<username>/<repository_name>:<tag>

			docker tag <old_name>:<old_tag> <new_name>
			
		2. Login with docker account 
			docker login 

		3. Push the images to your own repository 
			

Docker containers 
	To list all docker running containers 
		docker ps 
		   (OR)
		docker container ls 

	To list all docker containers (running, exited, paused ....)
		docker ps -a
		   (OR)
		docker container ls -a
		
	To delete all docker containers except (running)
		docker rm <conatiner_name> 
		docker rm <container_id> 
	
	To stop all running container 
		docker stop $(docker ps -q)	
		
	To delete a running docker container 
		1. Forcefully delete 
			docker rm -f <container_id>

		2. Gracefully delete 
			2a. docker stop <container_id>
			2b. docker rm <container_id>
				(OR)
			To stop and delete running container in one-line
				docker rm $(docker stop <container_id>) 
						(OR)
				docker stop <container_id> | xargs -I{} docker rm "{}"
	
	To list all stopped containers 
		docker ps --filter "status=exited" -q

	To delete all the stopped containers 	
		docker rm $(docker ps --filter "status=exited" -q)

	To login / To get into a container 
		(To create a container docker run -it -d ubuntu /bin/bash)
		1. docker attach <container_id>
			To safely exit after attach (ctrl + (qp))
		2. docker exec -it /bin/bash 
			
	
Assignment: Try docker cp, docker pause, docker exec  

	docker cp 
		- This command is used to copy files and directories from host machine to container and 
		   container to host machine 
			From host machine to container 
				docker cp <host_path> <container_id>:<container_path> 

			From container to host machine 
				docker cp <container_id>:<container_path> <host_path>
	
	tty - we get output in console (stdstatus , stderror)

	docker exec 
		This command is used to run any command inside a running container and get the output.
	
To create a docker container 
	docker run -it -d <image_name>:<tag> <command>
	    Note: -i , interactive mode 
                  -t , tty terminal  		
		  -d , detached mode (creating container in background)
		  --name , User defined container name 
		  --rm, Once the container stops it will be deleted.			
		( Image name at the end of the command always. 
		  If we want to add command for execution then command 
		  should be at end followed by image name)

Dockerfile 
	Dockerfile is used to create custom images by using any stock image or we can use any existing 
	docker image as base images.
	In Dockerfile we write some instruction to update any existing image.

	
	To create a image from Dockerfile 
		docker build -t <image_name>:<tag> <build_location>
		
	To build image from a custom docker file 
		docker build -t <image_name>:<tag> -f <dockerfile_path> <build_location>
	FROM 
	   - FROM is the first instruction in Dockerfile 
	   - At least one FROM should be there in a Dockerfile 
           - FROM is used to specify the base image (source image) on top of which we execute other 
	     instructions to update the base images to get our custom image.	
		
		FROM <image_name>:<tag>

	RUN 
	   - This is used to execute the supported command on the base image.
	   - We can have multiple (n number) RUN instructions in a single Dockerfile.
	   - Each RUN is an individual executor. Different RUN instructions never share the build context 
	     with each other.
	
		RUN <command>	
	WORKDIR 
	
	COPY and ADD 
		COPY <source> <destination>
	   	  - COPY is used to copy files and directories from HOST machine to the image. When we 
	     	    create container out of this image it will also contains the files and directories 
	     	    which we copied.
	   	  - <source> location is always calculated in build context location (Not as of HOST machine)	
	   	  - <destination> is the path inside the container, If does not exists it will be created 
	     	    automatically. 	
	
		- Both COPY and ADD instruction is used to copy files and directories from host machine to
		  image which will be copied to container which is created from this image.
		- ADD instruction support 2 more extra formats 
		     1. If source is a downloadable link, ADD will download the file to the destination.
		     2. If it is compressed file, ADD will un-compresses it in the destination.
